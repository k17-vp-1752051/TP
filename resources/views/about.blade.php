                K17 WIBU is a web and mobile app that helps you easily book a table.

                K17 WIBU was fully launched in October of 2015 and since then it has been growing like crazy.

                As we always like to say, this is just the beginning. The vision of our team is to do explore a bunch of ideas, filter the best ones and bring them to life.

                <h3>Great People</h3>

We have a passion for great people. Our team consists of hard working, fast learning, dedicated team players who have a constant itch to ‚Äúcreate‚Äù.

The Foody team currently consists of 41 team members. We are currently looking for great people to expand our team ‚Äì that‚Äôs not as easy as it sounds though.

We are not looking for good people to do a specific job.

We are looking for great people ‚Äì the best actually, who have the skills that are required by our team that will join our team, learn from our culture and experience, and then become better than us at what they do.

One of the questions we are often asked is how do we ‚Äúmeasure greatness‚Äù and the answer is quite simple.

We don‚Äôt really care about fancy university degrees (we don‚Äôt dismiss them either as we have more than enough in our team) or mouthwatering experience.

Instead we are looking for people that are fast learners, know how to roll their sleeves up and work and have a do-er attitude.

To see if people are a good fit with our team we try to work with them on a single project, or on a part time basis.

In general, we try to meet great people every day, learn from them and we believe that sooner or later we will have an opportunity to cooperate with them ‚Äì that‚Äôs actually one of the advantages of the small ecosystem in Cyprus.

<h3>Our Culture</h3>

Having great people means nothing if you are not building a great culture that allows everyone to flourish in it. And we are doing our best to continue building such a culture based on the learning and experiences of the team.

We have a lot of values that are ‚ÄúKey‚Äù to our culture:

<h3>Start with a Smile and you will have the Best Results</h3>

Yes Start with a smile is our first value. Not because we are ‚Äúgoddamn hippies‚Äù (not saying we aren‚Äôt) but because smiling and being happy as often as possible is one of the biggest and most sustainable Productivity Hacks anyone can do.

Why do we say that? Well there is a lot of research that backs it up and a great entry point to the research can be found here.

And that takes me to our next team Value:

<h3>Whatever Works</h3>

This is probably the value our team is most associated with cos‚Ä¶ well we like talking about it. In short we try very hard to make most of our decision based on hard data.

The data doesn‚Äôt have to be collected by us ‚Äì we try to learn as much as possible from others (hence we follow the results of scientific meta reviews) but we always create theories and hypotheses based on observation and then test them out with real data.

<h3>Always use the 80-20 rule</h3>

In almost every area of the world, you can achieve 80% of the results with 20% of the effort. We realize this time and time again and I am sure you have your own experiences that point to this direction.

A lot of the tech startups have similar values, like for example the ‚ÄúBetter done than perfect‚Äù of Facebook, and for good reason.

<h3>When things go Wrong you can either learn or assign Blame</h3>

We always choose to learn from things. This looks outright weird to our guests.

We often have major screw-ups, and we try to discuss them in the same way we discuss what ingredients we should add on our Pizza ‚Äì and then we laugh.

It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt take screw-ups seriously ‚Äì if we did we wouldn‚Äôt be here today, it‚Äôs that we realize that the screw-up is already been done and the best thing we can do is to learn as much as possible by it so we don‚Äôt do it again.

What‚Äôs the best way to learn? Have everyone be extremely open about what happened (including what they did wrong). And the only way to do that is if every member of the team knows that we the whole team is not looking to assign blame ‚Äì but to learn from the situation

<h3>Decide when to decide, and don‚Äôt question your choices when it‚Äôs not decision time</h3>

In the life of a startup each team member and the team as a whole faces a lot of decisions every day.

Sometimes we have to be decisive and give an answer right away, sometimes we must research the topic a lot more before we are ready to make a decision, and sometimes we must understand that now is the optimal time to make this decision.

This sounds simple ‚Äì but it really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs usually very difficult to do this effectively, without crossing the line and becoming a procrastinator.

Another reason this is very difficult, is that it means that there are open topics left on the table and in our heads. If we allow them to continue running around in our heads they will wreak havoc, but that‚Äôs exactly what most people do.

They say ok I will decide next month on the 12th because then I will have more data, BUT in the meantime the dilemma remains in their head and drives them crazy ‚Äì which is definitely not fun.

How can you do it correctly? That‚Äôs a topic for another time ‚Äì for now remember the Decide when to decide value.

<h3>Enjoy every day</h3>

There has been a lot of research showing that startups are not the best way if you want to make a lot of money, or have a strong career etc.

Starting up is all dirty work. It‚Äôs probably the toughest road you can take, and that makes sense, as if it was fast and easy everyone would be doing it.

Then why the hell do you people do and enjoy it?

Well for 2 reasons.

As I said at the beginning, all our team members have an ‚Äúunscratchable itch‚Äù to create and also know how to enjoy every day. The small wins and the goofy stuff.

If you can‚Äôt enjoy them, then joining a startup ain‚Äôt for you, as you will only see the mountains that you have to climb üôÇ

If you are ‚Äúnaive‚Äù enough to be able to enjoy the small wins, and also get a sense of happiness and fulfillment when you see something that you have created come to life, then maybe you`ll be a great fit with our team.

<h3>Great resources & stuff we love</h3>

As a team we are very motivated to see our Projects become a great success and we believe that success is the outcome of Smart and Hard Work.

As a guide in our quest, we very often use the Lean Startup Methodology. While we might not follow eeeeeverything in the methodology, we believe that it has a lot of Value and we generally use it as a guide.

At Foody we also realize that as Humans we often act in very weird ways. Thinking Fast and Slow is a great book that helps us understand our actions. I know it looks boring but really.. read it üôÇ

Btw, if you came to this article through any of the Job Openings we have well done. We really appreciate you taking the time to read more about our team and so if you decide to send us your CV include the phrase ‚ÄúAchievement unlocked‚Äù in your email to let us know that you read this üôÇ

<h3>This is getting too long</h3>

In fact way too long. Buuut in the rare case that you`d like to read more about how our team works (What‚Äôs wrong with you?:) ) you can check out our internal Culture knowledgebase here.

However there is one more question I`d like to address:

You guys think you have it all figured out, aren‚Äôt you a bit arrogant?

Let me answer this question with a brief story.

I have lot of regular tasks that are built on work I did in the past. Quite often, I touch on work I did two months or so ago and I really can‚Äôt believe what I see.

The work is very often bad, and appears stupid by the standards I have today. I mean did I really not know that there are a 100 better ways to do this?

The answer happily is yes ‚Äì I had no clue that this could be done in a better way and the only way I know that now is because I have learned so much over the last couple of months.

This experience happens to me and all of our team members every week and that‚Äôs a sign that we are all learning a lot of shit very fast.

This experience has a very fortunate side effect ‚Äì it helps realize how many things we still don‚Äôt know keep us humble, focused and dedicated to learning and creating great things.
